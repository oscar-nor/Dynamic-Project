    <p class="intro__p"> Probably the main, and most discussed, public policy issue in Mexico is poverty alleviation.
      CONEVAL (Mexicoâ€™s National Council for Social Development Policy Evaluation) calculates that in 2018 41.9% of the
      total population lived in poverty (roughly 52.4 million mexicans). Despite huge efforts, including a great number
      of social programs through the years, poverty stills prevails at levels above 40%.
      <br><br>
      However, the concept of poverty comprises various components or dimensions, that is, it is a multi-dimensional
      phenomenon that cannot be considered, solely and exclusively, by the goods and services that can be purchased in
      the market (ie. income measurement alone).
      <br><br>
      The goal of this project is to familiarize yourself briefly with the concept of multidimensional poverty
      measurement and its main difference with the normal income
      measurements. But mostly,for you to see the prevailing context in Mexico, how it may seem poverty has remained
      stagnant during six years, but how the internal
      dynamics of the country (ie. how states evolve through time) determine the aggregate measure, as well as showing
      that poverty is a geographically concentrated phenomenon in some sattes.

        <p class='sec'>Classical poverty measurement</p>
        Historically, the main indicator for measuring poverty was just a headcount
        of people who earned an income below a 'Poverty line'.
        <br><br>
        While this indicator has
        its advantages, one of the main ones being the ability to compare between different countries,
        these measurements doesn't account for the different contexts (even if using Purchase Power Parity, or PPP).
        <br><br>
        The chart on the left shows the comparison of Mexico vs another countries/zones, using a poverty line of
        $5.50 USD PPP by the World Bank aimed at approaching an international context of
        how Mexico can be compared, with its proper cautions, with the rest of the world.

        <p>Multidimensional measurement</p>
        CONEVAL defined a second dimension: Social Rights Deprivations. Based on six social rights:
        education, health, social security, housing, basic housing services and feeding.
        Combining this with monthly income measurement, CONEVAL defined 5 categories to classify the
        population:
        <br><br>
        1- Extreme Poverty: Having an income below the Minimum Welfare Line (MWL) and 3 or more Social Deprivations
        (SD).
        <br><br>
        2- Moderate Poverty: Having an income below the Economic Welfare Line (EWL) but above the MWL and at least 1
        SDs, or an income below the MWL and no more that two SDs.
        <br><br>
        3- Income vulnerability: Income below the EWL, but no SDs.
        <br><br>
        4- Social Deprivations vulnerability: Income above the EWL, and at least 1 SD.
        <br><br>
        5- Non poor or vulnerable: Income above the EWL, and no SDs.

        <p>Extreme Poverty Evolution by State</p>
        Now let's start seeing the heterogeneity of poverty evolution inside Mexico, by looking at its states.
        <br><br>
        Extreme Poverty, by construction, represents the most vulnerable portion
        of he population. These are mexicans whose income doesn't allow them
        to buy the Basic Food Basket.<br><br>
        In the last years we can see that in most states, there was a reduction in Extreme Poverty rates (something we
        already knew from the previous aggregate chart).
        <br><br> However, it's important to notice that some southern states saw
        a considerable increase,
        particularly Oaxaca, Veracruz and Morelos contrast with the rest of the Republic.
        <br><br>

      <div class='step' data-step='4'>
        <p>Moderate Poverty Evolution by State</p>
        Unlike Extreme poverty, we can see a more hetrogeneous evolution of mdoerate poverty rates
        by states. <br><br>
        On this map is clearer the North/South difference, where the South concentrates
        largest poverty rates compared tp the North. <br><br>
        It's highly likely that the people who
        moved out from extreme poverty went to moderate in the South states.<br><br>
        It's important to notice that, when refering to just 'Poverty rates' in Mexico, these are usually understood as
        the sum
        of Extreme and Moderate poverty rates. However, given the difference and the relevant reduction in Extreme
        poverty, we
        show both as a further reinforcement of the states heterogeneity and the multidimensionality measurement.

      <div class='step' data-step='5'>
        <p>Social Deprivations evolution by State</p>
        In terms of Social Deprivations vulnerability, we surprisingly see that one of the states with the lowest
        poverty levels, Baja California Sur, had the largest increase of population showing
        at least one social deprivation between 2012 and 2018.
        <br><br>
        Unexpected as well, Chiapas and Veracruz, two of the states with the highest poverty increases, are the states
        with
        the largest reduction of popuation having social deprivations. This reinforces a hypothesis that low income
        almost exclusively
        determines social deprivations on poorer states. <br><br>This implies that people with income below the poverty
        lines are
        unlikely to show social deprivations (on average)
        <br><br>

      <div class='step' data-step='6'>
        <p>Income Vulnerability evolution by State</p>
        Kind of expected, we see that the northern states have the highest negative percentage change of population
        having a low income,
        but no social deprivations. <br><br>This trend of income vulnerability reduction seems to have taken place at
        almost all
        states. However, the three
        states that concentrate the largest poverty rates (Chiapas, Oaxaca and Guerrero, clearly distinguable in the
        map) went against that nationwide trend<br><br>
        The story told by all the previous maps show us that in the North there's a broader
        access, and recent improvement, to the Social Rights defined by CONEVAL, even to people with low income, while
        in the South (at least the three poorer states) the social deprivations are almost solely for people with low
        income.

      <p>
        After looking at the broad heterogeneity across states for each of CONEVAL's poverty measurements, Now you can
        check each state individually an look at their time evolution. <br><br>This will further extend the
        understanding of how
        complicated
        the problem of multidimensional poverty is. While it's true that most of it seems to be focalized in some
        states, the truth is that this has been a persisting
        fact since many many years.
        <br><br>
        On the lower set of charts you can check the persistence for each of CONEVAL's Social Deprivations per state and
        see that
        there's one that
        dominates above the rest. Which one is it? What does it imply in a broader economic context? (Psst!...has to do
        with labor informality! ;) )<br><br>
